I have had requests for STLs so as promised here they are along with my build log, notes and attribution. 

## Purpose: 
I actually abandoned my Ender 3 to Switchwire conversion when I built my Voron 2.4. However, I have decided to give it some love again since I'm planning to mod my V2.4 into a Stealthchanger and didn't want to risk dissasembling my only ABS capable machine.

### Disclaimer: 
This is purely a passion project and learning journey and does not make financial sense to do compared to buying a P1S or Centauri Carbon. 

## Mods: 
1. The meat and heart is still an E3NG 1.2 at its core assisted with the Funssor Kit. 
2. Toolhead: Dragon Burner mounted on Chaotic Labs Tap V2 + Orbiter V2 + Rapido 2 + Orbitool 02 Can
3. Custom 3D Printed enclosure with recycled panels from my V2.4. The design aesthetic is from my V2.4 which was inspired by DoomCube
4. I decided on a notched spool holder to reduce internal volume for faster chamber heating. 
5. The acrylic top is easily removable with the magnetic frame. 
6. Door latch is Doom Mini Latch
7. Custom Nozzle brush holder for scrubby duties. (I intend on moving this to the bed screws when I get longer bed screws.
8. Removing floor held in place with magnets for easy printed crumb collection.
9. Recycled an old BTT TFT 35 SPI (which is pretty rubbish).
10. Logitech C920 mounted Front Upper Right corner.

## Slicing & Printing
1. I have included a fully assembled STL for those who have trouble assembling. However it should be fairly self explanatory.
2. STL's are divided into "sides" as I was too lazy to export individual parts.
3. Most parts were printed on my Voron 350mm with larger parts broken down into two within the slicer.
4. The parts with Hexagon mesh were slicer generated with Hexagon infill. 0 bottom layers 5 top layers 8 walls (rotate infill 30 degs)
5. Most aesthetic pieces were printed with 3 walls 4 bottom 4 tops 10-15% infill.
6. Anything important was printed with Voron Specs.
